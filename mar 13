what i learned today was 
print("SECURE LOGIN")
username = input("Username > ")
if username == "Nutella":
  print("Welcome Nutella!")
elif username == "suzanne":
  print("Hey there Suzanne!")
else: 
  print("Go away!")


  i also learned the day 6 challenge 
  print("Secure Login")
username = input("What is your username?")
password = input("What is your password?")
if username == "Arabella" and password == "Nutella":
  print("Welcome, Arabella! You are looking nice today!")
elif username == "Sarah" and password == "Stemcollegiate":
  print("Hi sarah! Love your hair today!")
elif username == "juliet" and password == "Romeo":
  print("Yo! juliet! What up?!")
